Delete a worktree and optionally its associated branch without launching the TUI.

Auto-detects the current worktree from the working directory. Automatically deletes the associated branch if the worktree directory name matches the branch name.

## Syntax

```bash
lazyworktree delete [options] [worktree-path]
```

## Options

<ParamField path="worktree-path" type="string">
  Optional worktree path, branch name, or directory name to delete. If not provided, auto-detects from the current working directory.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--no-branch" type="boolean">
  Skip branch deletion entirely (even if worktree name matches branch name).
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--silent" type="boolean">
  Suppress all progress messages to stderr. Useful for scripting and automation.
</ParamField>

## Examples

```bash
# Delete worktree and branch (auto-detected from cwd)
lazyworktree delete

# Delete worktree only, keep branch
lazyworktree delete --no-branch

# Delete specific worktree
lazyworktree delete my-feature
```
