description: Rename a worktree without launching the TUI
---

Rename a worktree directory without launching the TUI. The branch is renamed only if the current worktree directory name matches the branch name.

## Syntax

```bash
lazyworktree rename [old-name] new-name
```

## Arguments

<ParamField path="new-name" type="string" required>
  New worktree name. It is sanitised to lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. When given as the only argument, the current worktree (detected from the working directory) is renamed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="old-name" type="string">
  The worktree path, branch name, or directory name to rename. If omitted, auto-detects the current worktree from the working directory.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--silent" type="boolean">
  Suppress all progress messages to stderr. Useful for scripting and automation.
</ParamField>

## Examples

```bash
# Rename current worktree (detected from cwd)
lazyworktree rename new-feature-name

# Rename by name
lazyworktree rename feature new-feature-name

# Rename by path
lazyworktree rename /path/to/worktree new-worktree-name
```

## Notes

- The branch is renamed only when the current worktree directory name matches the branch name
- Shell completion suggests available worktree basenames for the first argument
