---

Get up and running with LazyWorktree quickly. This guide walks you through your first worktree operations.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Git 2.31 or later installed
- A Git repository to work with
- LazyWorktree installed (see [Installation](/installation))

<Note>
For PR/MR integration features, you'll also need `gh` (GitHub CLI) or `glab` (GitLab CLI) installed.
</Note>

## Launch LazyWorktree

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your repository">
    Open your terminal and navigate to any Git repository:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/git/repository
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run LazyWorktree">
    Launch the TUI by running:

    ```bash
    lazyworktree
    ```

    You'll see the main interface with your worktrees listed (if any exist).
  </Step>

  <Step title="View help">
    Press `?` to view the interactive help screen with all available key bindings.

    Press `q` or `Esc` to close the help screen.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create your first worktree

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press 'c' to create">
    Press the `c` key to open the worktree creation menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose creation method">
    Select from several creation options:

    - **From current branch** - Copy your current branch to a new worktree
    - **From branch** - Create from an existing branch or new branch name
    - **From PR/MR** - Create from a GitHub/GitLab pull/merge request
    - **From issue** - Create from a GitHub/GitLab issue with auto-generated branch name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter worktree name">
    Type the name for your new worktree (or accept the auto-generated name).

    LazyWorktree will automatically sanitise special characters to be Git-compatible.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for creation">
    LazyWorktree creates the worktree in your configured directory (default: `~/.local/share/worktrees/<org>-<repo>`).

    The new worktree appears in the list immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigate to a worktree

There are two ways to jump into a worktree:

### Method 1: Direct output

1. Select a worktree with `j`/`k` (or arrow keys)
2. Press `Enter` - LazyWorktree outputs the path and exits
3. Use this with your shell:

```bash
cd $(lazyworktree)
```

### Method 2: Shell integration (recommended)

For a better experience, set up shell integration to automatically change directories:

```bash zsh
# Add to ~/.zshrc
lwcd() {
  local selected_path=$(lazyworktree)
  if [[ -n "$selected_path" ]]; then
    cd "$selected_path"
  fi
}
```

Then use:

```bash
lwcd  # Select and jump to worktree
```

See [Shell Integration](/guides/shell-integration) for more advanced setups.

## Common operations

### View worktree information

- Focus on a worktree to see details in the **Status pane** (right side)
- View linked PR/MR information
- Check CI status (if GitHub Actions or GitLab CI configured)
- See branch divergence from upstream

### Rename a worktree

1. Select the worktree
2. Press `m` (rename)
3. Enter the new name
4. The branch is renamed too if the directory name matches the branch name

### Delete a worktree

1. Select the worktree
2. Press `D` (delete)
3. Confirm the deletion
4. Both the worktree directory and branch are removed

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent! Make sure you've committed or pushed any important changes.
</Warning>
