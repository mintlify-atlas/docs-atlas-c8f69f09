title: Worktree Management
description: Create, rename, remove, absorb, and prune merged worktrees
---

LazyWorktree provides comprehensive worktree lifecycle management with keyboard-driven operations.

## Default Worktree Location

Worktrees are stored in:

```
~/.local/share/worktrees/<organization>-<repo_name>
```

You can customise this location via the `worktree_dir` configuration option.

## Core Operations

### Create Worktree

Press **`c`** to open the creation menu with multiple options:

- Create from current branch with or without uncommitted changes
- Checkout existing branch or create new branch
- Create from GitHub/GitLab issue with automatic branch naming
- Create from open PR/MR

<Note>
See [Creation Modes](/features/creation-modes) for detailed creation workflows.
</Note>

### Rename Worktree

Press **`m`** to rename the selected worktree.

- Renames both the worktree directory and branch (if names match)
- Updates all internal references
- Preserves worktree notes and metadata

Branch naming follows Git conventions:
- Special characters (`.`, `:`, spaces) are converted to hyphens
- Leading/trailing hyphens are removed
- Consecutive hyphens are collapsed
- Length capped at 50 characters for manual input

### Delete Worktree

Press **`D`** to delete the selected worktree.

- Removes the worktree directory
- Prompts whether to delete the associated branch
- Cleans up worktree notes automatically

<Warning>
Deleting a worktree cannot be undone. Ensure you've committed or stashed any important changes.
</Warning>

### Absorb Worktree

Press **`A`** to merge the selected worktree back into the main branch.

The absorb operation:
1. Switches to the main worktree
2. Merges or rebases the feature branch (based on `merge_method` config)
3. Deletes the feature worktree and branch

<CodeGroup>
```yaml config.yaml (Rebase)
merge_method: "rebase"  # Default
```

```yaml config.yaml (Merge)
merge_method: "merge"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Absorb is perfect for cleaning up feature branches after completing work.
</Tip>

### Prune Merged Worktrees

Press **`X`** to prune all merged worktrees.

The prune operation:
1. Refreshes PR/MR data from GitHub/GitLab
2. Checks each worktree's merge status
3. Deletes worktrees with merged branches
4. Removes orphaned worktree references

<Note>
Requires `gh` CLI for GitHub or `glab` CLI for GitLab to check PR/MR status.
</Note>

## Key Bindings Summary

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `c` | Create new worktree |
| `m` | Rename selected worktree |
| `D` | Delete selected worktree |
| `A` | Absorb worktree into main |
| `X` | Prune merged worktrees |

## Navigation and Selection

- **`j` / `k`** - Move selection up/down
- **`Enter`** - Jump to worktree (exit and cd)
- **`f`** - Filter worktrees by name
- **`/`** - Search worktrees (incremental)
- **`s`** - Cycle sort mode (Path / Last Active / Last Switched)

<Tip>
Use the filter (`f`) to quickly narrow down worktrees in large repositories.
</Tip>

## Branch Naming Conventions

Special characters are automatically converted for Git compatibility:

| Input | Converted |
| --- | --- |
| `feature.new` | `feature-new` |
| `bug fix here` | `bug-fix-here` |
| `feature:test` | `feature-test` |

- Leading/trailing hyphens removed
- Consecutive hyphens collapsed
- Manual input: 50 characters max
- Auto-generated: 100 characters max
