# Installation

Choose your preferred installation method to get started with LazyWorktree.

## Requirements

Before installing LazyWorktree, ensure you have the following requirements:

### Required

### Optional

These tools enhance your LazyWorktree experience:

- **Nerd Font**: Icons default to Nerd Font glyphs for a better visual experience

<Note>
If you see weird characters when starting LazyWorktree, either set `icon_set: text` in your configuration or install a font patched with Nerd Font.
</Note>

- **delta**: Provides syntax-highlighted diffs (recommended)
- **lazygit**: Enables full TUI git control within LazyWorktree
- **tmux / zellij**: For per-worktree session management
- **[aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat)**: Or similar LLM CLI for automatic branch naming from diffs/issues/PRs

### Build Requirements

## Installation Methods

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Installation Method">
    Select the method that works best for your operating system and preferences.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Homebrew (macOS)

The easiest way to install LazyWorktree on macOS:

```bash
brew tap chmouel/lazyworktree https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree
brew install lazyworktree --cask
```

#### macOS Gatekeeper Warning

If macOS shows "Apple could not verify lazyworktree", you have two options:

<Warning>
macOS Gatekeeper may block LazyWorktree on first launch because it's not signed by Apple.
</Warning>

**Option 1: System Settings**

1. Go to System Settings
2. Navigate to Privacy & Security
3. Click "Open Anyway" next to the LazyWorktree warning

**Option 2: Remove quarantine attribute**

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /opt/homebrew/bin/lazyworktree
```

### Pre-built Binaries

Pre-built binaries are available for multiple platforms:

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree/releases)
2. Download the binary for your operating system
3. Extract the archive
4. Move the binary to a directory in your `PATH`

```bash
# Example for Linux
tar -xzf lazyworktree-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv lazyworktree /usr/local/bin/
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)

For Arch Linux users, LazyWorktree is available in the AUR:

```bash
yay -S lazyworktree-bin
```

Or with your preferred AUR helper:

```bash
paru -S lazyworktree-bin
```

### From Source

If you have Go installed, you can install LazyWorktree directly:

**Direct installation:**

```bash
go install github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree/cmd/lazyworktree@latest
```

**Via cloning and building:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree.git
cd lazyworktree
go build -o lazyworktree ./cmd/lazyworktree
```

Then move the binary to your `PATH`:

```bash
sudo mv lazyworktree /usr/local/bin/
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that LazyWorktree is working:

```bash
lazyworktree --version
```

You should see the version information displayed.

## Shell Integration (Optional)

For the best experience, set up shell integration to easily navigate to worktrees. Shell helpers change directory to the selected worktree on exit.

Zsh helpers are available in the `shell/functions.zsh` file in the repository. See the [shell README](https://github.com/chmouel/lazyworktree/blob/main/shell/README.md) for setup details.

<Tip>
Shell integration allows you to use commands like `cd $(lazyworktree)` to jump directly to a selected worktree.
