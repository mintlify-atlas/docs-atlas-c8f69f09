## Pane Navigation

Use number keys to focus specific panes, or navigation keys to move between them:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | Focus Worktree pane (toggle zoom if focused) |
| `2` | Focus Status pane (toggle zoom if focused) |
| `3` | Focus Git Status pane (toggle zoom if focused) |
| `4` | Focus Commit pane (toggle zoom if focused) |

| `Tab`, `]` | Cycle to next pane |
| `[` | Cycle to previous pane |
| `=` | Toggle zoom for focused pane (full screen) |
| `L` | Toggle layout (default / top) |

## Clipboard Operations

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `y` | Copy to clipboard (context-aware: path in worktrees, file path in git status, SHA in commit; uses OSC52, works over SSH) |
| `Y` | Copy selected worktree branch name to clipboard |

<Note>
Clipboard operations use OSC52, which means they work seamlessly over SSH connections without requiring local clipboard utilities.
</Note>

## Commit Pane

| `j/k` | Navigate commits |
| `ctrl+j` | Next commit and open file tree |
| `/` | Search commit titles (incremental) |

### Commit File Tree

When viewing files in a commit:

| Key | Action |

## Notes Viewer and Editor

Press `i` to open notes for the selected worktree. If a note already exists, LazyWorktree opens a viewer first; if no note exists, it opens the editor.

<Note>
Worktrees with notes display a note marker beside the name. The Info pane renders Markdown formatting for headings, bold text, inline code, lists, quotes, links, and fenced code blocks. Uppercase note tags such as `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `WARNING:` are highlighted with icons outside fenced code blocks, whilst lowercase tags remain unchanged.
</Note>

## Taskboard

Press `T` to open Taskboard, a Kanban-lite view grouped by worktree:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |

| `Enter`, `Space` | Toggle task completion |
| `a` | Add a new task |
| `f` | Filter tasks |
| `q`, `Esc` | Close Taskboard |

<Note>
Taskboard collects only markdown checkbox items from notes (for example, `- [ ] draft release notes` and `- [x] update changelog`).
</Note>

## Command History

When using the `!` key to run arbitrary commands:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑`/`↓` | Navigate command history |

<Tip>
Command history is saved per repository with a maximum of 100 entries, making it easy to re-run frequently used commands.
</Tip>

## Command Palette Actions

Access the command palette with `ctrl+p` or `:`:

- **Select theme**: Change theme with live preview
- **Create from current branch**: Copy current branch to a new worktree. Tick "Include current file changes" to carry over uncommitted changes

## Mouse Controls

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Click** | Select and focus panes or items |
| **Scroll** | Navigate lists in any pane |

<Tip>
Whilst LazyWorktree is optimised for keyboard-driven workflows, mouse support is available for those who prefer it or are learning the keyboard shortcuts.
