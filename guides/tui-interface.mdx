description: Understanding the LazyWorktree TUI interface and navigation
---

LazyWorktree provides a powerful TUI (Text User Interface) built with [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) that focuses on fast iteration, clear state visibility, and tight Git tooling integration.

## Interface Overview

The LazyWorktree interface is organized into multiple panes, each providing specific information and functionality:

1. **Worktree Pane** (1) - Main list of Git worktrees
2. **Status Pane** (2) - PR info, CI checks, notes, and divergence status
3. **Git Status Pane** (3) - Changed files in the selected worktree
4. **Commit Pane** (4) - Commit history for the selected worktree
5. **Notes Pane** (5) - Per-worktree notes (visible only when a note exists)

## Pane Navigation

### Number Keys for Direct Focus

Use the number keys `1` through `5` to jump directly to a specific pane:

- Press `1` to focus the Worktree pane
- Press `2` to focus the Status pane
- Press `3` to focus the Git Status pane
- Press `4` to focus the Commit pane
- Press `5` to focus the Notes pane (only visible when the selected worktree has a note)

<Tip>
Pressing the number key for an already-focused pane will toggle zoom mode, expanding that pane to full screen.
</Tip>

### Directional Navigation

You can also navigate between panes using directional keys:

- **`h`** - Navigate to the Worktree pane (left)
- **`l`** - Cycle through right panes (Status, Git Status, Commit, Notes)
- **`Tab`** or **`]`** - Cycle to the next pane
- **`[`** - Cycle to the previous pane

## Worktree Pane

The main pane displays all Git worktrees for the current repository. Each entry shows:

- Worktree name
- Current branch
- Note marker (if notes exist)
- Additional status indicators

Use `j`/`k` or arrow keys to navigate the list, and `Enter` to jump to the selected worktree (exits LazyWorktree and outputs the path).

### Sort Modes

Press `s` to cycle through different sort modes:

1. **Path** - Sort alphabetically by worktree path
2. **Last Active** - Sort by commit date (most recently committed first)
3. **Last Switched** - Sort by last accessed time (most recently used first)

<Tip>
The "Last Switched" sort mode is particularly useful for finding the worktrees you've been working on recently.
</Tip>

## Status Pane

The Status pane displays comprehensive information about the selected worktree:

- **PR/MR Information** - Linked pull request or merge request details
- **CI Status** - Current CI check status and results
- **Notes Preview** - Rendered markdown notes with formatting
- **Divergence Status** - How far ahead/behind the worktree is from upstream

### CI Checks

When CI checks are visible:

- Use `j`/`k` to navigate between checks
- Press `Enter` to open the selected check in your browser
- Press `Ctrl+v` to view check logs in the pager
- Press `Ctrl+r` to restart the job (GitHub Actions only)

## Git Status Pane

Displays changed files in a collapsible tree view, grouped by directory (similar to lazygit):

- Navigate with `j`/`k`
- Press `Enter` to toggle directory collapse/expand or show file diffs
- Press `e` to open a file in your editor
- Press `s` to stage/unstage files or directories
- Press `d` to show the full diff in a pager

<Note>
The tree view intelligently groups files by directory, making it easy to manage changes across multiple folders.
</Note>

### Folder Navigation

Use `ctrl+←` and `ctrl+→` to jump between folders quickly when working with deeply nested directory structures.

## Commit Pane

Shows the commit history for the selected worktree:

- Navigate commits with `j`/`k`
- Press `Enter` to view the commit's file tree
- Press `d` to show the full commit diff in a pager
- Press `C` to cherry-pick the commit to another worktree
- Press `ctrl+j` to move to the next commit and open its file tree

### Commit File Tree

When viewing files changed in a commit:

- Navigate with `j`/`k`
- Press `Enter` on directories to expand/collapse them
- Press `Enter` on files to view their diff
- Use `ctrl+d`/`ctrl+u` for half-page navigation
- Press `g`/`G` to jump to top/bottom
- Press `q` or `Esc` to return to the commit log

## Notes Pane

The Notes pane appears only when the selected worktree has an associated note. It displays rendered markdown with support for:

- Headings
- Bold text and inline code
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Quotes
- Links
- Fenced code blocks
- Highlighted tags (`TODO`, `FIXME`, `WARNING:`)

Press `i` to open the notes viewer or editor, or press `5` to focus the Notes pane directly.

## View Controls

### Zoom Mode

Press `=` to toggle zoom mode for the currently focused pane. This expands the pane to full screen, hiding all other panes for maximum viewing space.

<Tip>
You can also toggle zoom by pressing the number key for the currently focused pane. For example, if pane 3 is focused, press `3` to zoom it.
</Tip>

### Layout Toggle

Press `L` to toggle between two layout modes:

1. **Default Layout** - Standard multi-pane view with panes arranged side by side
2. **Top Layout** - Alternative arrangement with different pane positioning

## Filter and Search Modes

### Filter Mode

Press `f` to activate filter mode for the focused pane (works on worktrees, files, and commits):

- Type to filter items in real-time
- Use `alt+n`/`alt+p` to navigate and update the filter input
- Use `↑`/`↓` to navigate without changing the input
- Press `Enter` to exit filter mode whilst keeping the filter active
- Press `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` to clear the filter

When a filter is active, you'll see a `[Esc] Clear` hint in the interface.

### Search Mode

Press `/` to activate incremental search:

- Type to jump to the first matching item
- Press `n` for the next match
- Press `N` for the previous match
- Press `Enter` to close search
- Press `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` to clear search

<Note>
Search mode provides incremental matching, meaning it updates results as you type, making it fast to find specific items.
</Note>

## Command Palette

Press `ctrl+p` or `:` to open the command palette, which provides quick access to common actions:

- **Select theme** - Change the UI theme with live preview
- **Create from current branch** - Copy the current branch to a new worktree
- **Custom commands** - Access user-defined commands and tmux/zellij sessions

The command palette features MRU (Most Recently Used) based navigation, making frequently used commands appear at the top.

## Visual Elements

### Icons

LazyWorktree uses Nerd Font icons by default for a rich visual experience. If you see strange characters, either install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) or set `icon_set: text` in your configuration.

### Themes

LazyWorktree supports multiple themes that can be changed on the fly using the command palette. See the [Themes configuration](/configuration/themes) for available options.

### Status Indicators

- **Note marker** - Indicates worktrees with associated notes
- **Branch indicators** - Show current branch and tracking status
- **PR/MR badges** - Display linked pull/merge request status
- **CI status icons** - Show CI check results (passing, failing, pending)

## Markdown Rendering

Notes and information displayed in the Status pane support rich Markdown formatting:

- Headings are styled hierarchically
- Code blocks are syntax highlighted (when using delta)
- Lists are properly indented
- Links are highlighted
- Special tags like `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `WARNING:` are highlighted with icons (uppercase only, lowercase remains unchanged)

<Warning>
Tag highlighting only applies to uppercase tags outside fenced code blocks. Lowercase tags and tags within code blocks are not highlighted.
</Warning>

## Getting Help

Press `?` at any time to display the built-in help screen, which shows available key bindings for the current context.
