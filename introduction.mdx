## What are Git Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories attached to the same repository. Instead of switching branches and losing your current work context, you can:

- Work on multiple branches simultaneously
- Keep long-running feature branches in separate directories
- Review pull requests without disrupting your current work
- Run tests on one branch while developing on another

LazyWorktree makes managing these worktrees effortless with a visual, keyboard-driven interface.

## Why LazyWorktree?

- **Fast**: Built with Go and BubbleTea for instant startup and responsive UI
- **Keyboard-driven**: Complete control without leaving your keyboard
- **Git-native**: Tight integration with GitHub, GitLab, and CI systems
- **Customizable**: Extensive configuration options, custom commands, and themes
